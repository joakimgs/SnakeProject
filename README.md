# SnakeProject

This program is an algorithm that uses techniques of branch predication to guide a snake to cover as much area described by *n* columns and *m* rows. In the area where there are obstacles (red) the snake cannot visit.

Input file = 
n,m,k
x1,y1
x2,y2

* *n* and *m* (number of rows and number of columns)
* *k* (number of forbidden fieds)
* *xi, yi* (coordinates of the forbidden fields)
